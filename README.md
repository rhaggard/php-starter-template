What is this?
===

This is a PHP starter template based on the wonderful F3 (Fat-free-framework) that demonstrates how messages are sent back and forth between two capabilities using the X.commerce platform.

This code is cloud deployment ready. 
As an example look at http://xphp.phpfogapp.com

How
====
First, set up an account on phpfog. This enables you to easily view the sample and have it ready for cloud deployment as you make changes to it.

Then clone this repo and dump the folder into your localhost/webroot directory. Update the .htaccess file and change the following line
	
	RewriteBase /php_starter_template

to whereever your sub folder resides. This is a requirement for F3 to work.

Done! You have a bundle to be ready to deploy to the cloud.
