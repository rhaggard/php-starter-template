What is this?
===

A PHP starter template based on the wonderful F3 (Fat-free-framework) that implements a sample X.commerce use case - https://www.x.com/developers/x.commerce/documentation-tools/how-to-guides/x.commerce-messaging-basics-page-4

This code is cloud deployment ready. 
As an example look at http://xphp.phpfogapp.com

How
====
Clone this repo and dump the folder into your localhost/webroot directory. Update the .htaccess file and change the following line
	
	RewriteBase /php_xcommerce

to where ever your sub folder resides. This is a requirement for F3 to work.

Done! You have a bundle to be ready to deploy to cloud.
